  "description": "A generic searchable list is a flexible and dynamic component designed to display a list of items that users can search through efficiently. This component is built to be adaptable to various data types and can be integrated into different parts of an application. Its generic nature means that it is not tied to a specific type of data, making it highly reusable and customizable.",
